# dotfiles

This repository contains some of my dotfiles that I have implemented in my configuration to boost my workflow
and tailor my experience towards a direction I desire.

Currently the dotfiles I have published cover the following
1) Vim - A basic config for making documents with **LaTeX**
2) Waybar - A taskbar for my **Hyprland** rice


Still want more?

I have a GitHub repository that contains my **NeoVim** config. It contains various plugins that are necessary
for a modern software development experience. The config may eventually be included here, but currently it is
maintained in a separate repository.
