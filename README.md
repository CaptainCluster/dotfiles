This repository contains some of my dotfiles that I have implemented in my configuration to boost my workflow
and tailor my experience towards a direction I desire.

Currently the dotfiles I have published cover the following
1) Vim - A basic config for making documents with **LaTeX**
2) Waybar - A taskbar for my **Hyprland** rice
